# Duordle

Duordle is a word-guessing game inspired by the Hebrew word game called [Milotayim](https://milotayim.com), which is in its turn inspired by the popular game [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).
In Duordle, players are challenged to guess two five-letter English words that are semantically related based on the given clues.

## How to Play
**Objective**: The goal of Duordle is to guess two five-letter words that are semantically related.

**Hints**: At the beginning of each game, players have no hints about the words or their relationship. After each guess, Duordle provides hints as follows:

- *Green*: Indicates a correctly-positioned letter.
- *Yellow*: Indicates a letter that is present but incorrectly positioned.
- *Dark Grey*: Indicates a letter that is not present in the word.
Guessing: Players input their guesses into the provided text input fields. The game evaluates the guesses and provides feedback based on how close the guesses are to the correct words.

**Winning**: The player wins the game by correctly guessing both words within a maximum of 7 guesses.
